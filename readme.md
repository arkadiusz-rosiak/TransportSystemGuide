# Transport System Guide

**Important fact is that it was my first big project and unfortunately it's not created using neither design patterns nor test driven development**

This project is based on **Java 8** + **Spring boot 1.4** + **Hibernate 5.2** + **Maven 3**. Transport System Guide helps
in planning journeys via public transport. It can find both direct and indirect journeys (However this is not the 
best algorithm and requires much work). The main reason to do this project was learning java and I know that there are many
imperfections but I'm still learning and I hope someday I find them and will never ever make them again :)

Live API preview is available here: http://api-rosiakit.rhcloud.com
And here is sample web application using it: http://transport.rosiak.it/ (I'm not the best in front-end :) )

Live preview contains data about Pozna≈Ñ (data gathered by ZTMPoznanCrawler) and Sroda Wielkopolska (data gathered by KombusCrawler).
