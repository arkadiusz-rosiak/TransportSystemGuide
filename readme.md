# Transport System Guide

This project is based on **Java 8** + **Spring boot 1.4** + **Hibernate 5.2** + **Maven 3**. Transport System Guide helps
in planning journeys via public transport. It can find both direct and indirect journeys (However this is not the 
best algorithm and requires much work). The main reason to do this project was learning java and I know that there are many
imperfections but I'm still learning and I hope someday I find them and will never ever make them again :)

Live API preview is available here: http://api-rosiakit.rhcloud.com
And here is sample web application using it: http://rosiak.it/ptsg/ (I'm not the best in front-end :) )

Live preview contains data about Pozna≈Ñ (data gathered by ZTMPoznanCrawler) and Sroda Wielkopolska (data gathered by KombusCrawler).
